# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – SQL-Based Business Insights

## Project Background
This project was developed to simulate a real-world business reporting scenario, where raw sales data is transformed into structured insights for decision-making.
The focus is on using SQL to produce **business-ready metrics** that can be directly consumed by stakeholders or integrated into BI tools.

---

## Business Context

In many analytics roles, stakeholders require timely insights without the overhead of complex modelling or advanced tooling. SQL-based EDA is often the **first and most critical step** in understanding business performance, validating assumptions, and identifying opportunities or risks.

This project simulates a scenario where an analyst is asked to:

* Assess overall sales performance
* Identify high-value customers and segments
* Evaluate product-level contribution and trends

The goal is not predictive modelling, but **clear, explainable insights grounded in data**.

---

## Data Source

The analysis is performed on a **business-ready sales data mart** produced by an upstream ETL pipeline (Gold layer).

Key characteristics:

* Cleaned and standardised data
* Star schema design
* Suitable for BI and analytical exploration

This ensures the focus of the project remains on **analysis and insight**, rather than data preparation.

---

## Analysis Scope

The EDA is structured into three logical sections, each implemented as a standalone SQL report.

### 1. Overall Business Analysis

Key questions explored:

* Total sales and revenue distribution
* Order volume and sales trends
* Average order value and quantity patterns

This section provides a high-level view of business performance and establishes baseline metrics.

---

### 2. Customer Analysis

Key questions explored:

* Customer contribution to total sales
* High-value and repeat customers
* Customer distribution by geography and attributes

The focus is on understanding **who drives revenue** and identifying meaningful customer segments.

---

### 3. Product Analysis

Key questions explored:

* Top-performing products and categories
* Revenue and quantity contribution by product
* Product mix and maintenance characteristics

This section supports product and category-level decision-making.

## Analytical Approach

The analysis relies on:

* Aggregations and grouping
* Window functions where appropriate
* Business-oriented metrics rather than purely technical outputs

Queries are written to be:

* Readable and maintainable
* Easy to adapt for BI or dashboarding use cases
* Suitable for peer review or handover

---

## Skills Involved

This project demonstrates the following analyst-relevant capabilities:

* SQL-based exploratory data analysis
* Translating business questions into analytical queries
* Interpreting transactional data at multiple levels
* Structuring analysis for stakeholder consumption
* Working with analytics-ready data models

## Key Deliverables
- Clean, well-structured SQL scripts for reporting purposes
- Reusable queries designed for business analysis
- Metrics aligned with common BI and dashboard requirements
- Outputs suitable for stakeholder-facing reports
