# SQL Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Background
This project was developed to simulate a real-world business reporting scenario, where raw sales data is transformed into structured insights for decision-making.
The focus is on using SQL to produce **business-ready metrics** that can be directly consumed by stakeholders or integrated into BI tools.
